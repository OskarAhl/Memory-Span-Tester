# Memory-Span-Tester
User can test if users memory is good enough to remember a sequence of ten events. Inspired by the classic Simon-game and created as a final project for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Certificate. 

## Stack: 
Front end: Html, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Howler.JS

## How is it made?
- Sequence Array with random colors – will be incremented with one new random color when the turn is complete.
- Clicked Array with clicked colors: e.g. click blue and then push “blue” into clicked array
- Compare Sequence and Clicked array to see if user is correct!
- Biggest challenge: setTimeout function within forEach iteration (solved with IFFEs)
